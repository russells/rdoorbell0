This is a doorbell that can't be rung continuously.

It has these component:

- External button

- Light on the external button

- External chime/buzzer

- Internal bell

It operates like this:

- While waiting for the button to be pressed, the light on the external
  button is on.

- When the button is pressed, the internal bell will ring, the external
  chime will sound, and the light on the external button will switch off.

- After the internal bell rings, there is a pause period, during which
  pressing the button will not ring the internal bell, but will sound the
  external buzzer.

- If the button is pressed during the pause period, the pause period will
  be restarted.  It will also be made longer, up to a maximum period.

- The light on the external button will remain off until the (possibly
  restarted and extended) pause period has expired.

- The internal bell can only be rung if the external light is on.

The original project grew like Topsy, and lost sight of its mission.  This one
is intended to remain simple, and only implement the delayed doorbell.
